# Pixcap
This Repository contains the solutions to the pixcap QA Engineer assessment

To run this project, you need to have npm installed or run the command `npm install` in your directory till the `node_modules` folder appears in your directory

After installation of the required modules.

Run `npx cypress run` to run the project in the terminal for Screenshots comparison to occur.

You can check the videos folder to check the run.

The 'Baseline Image' can be found in the snapshots folder.

I simulated a scenario where I made the script fail on purpose so that you can see the Image comparison algorithm in action. You can see the image in the `__diff_output__` folder that is under the snapshots folder.

The Spec file for the test is named `Pixcap.js` and is found under the `Integration` folder
